# Exam 2 - Program that Converts US Dollars to CAN Dollars

For this project, we had to Write a program that converts US dollars into 
Canadian dollars. The program should let the user 
enter an amount in US dollars and display the equivalent value in Canadian 
dollars when the Convert button is clicked. One Canadian dollar is 0.73 US.
All good coding styles, conventions and standards must be used when completing 
this project in order to get full credit.

## Analysis Steps

The requirements of this program appeared to be very easy when I looked at them. 
For that reason, I wanted to take it a step further and implement a button
that allowed the user to select which currency to change to. I started writing 
this README after I had created the "front end" of the project, so I will guess 
we will find out whether or not I completed the additional requirements or not. 

### Design

I broke my approach up into smaller, bite-sized pieces so that the project does 
not become overwhelming. I started by mimicking the design of the image that was
provided for us to get an idea of what the program requirements were. I guess
I will start going into the steps so that I don't run out of anything to say. 

### Testing

Step one: 

```
First, I created the front end of the program. Everything that the user would see
I created in this step. Since I was familiar with Grid Pane, Radio Buttons, 
Buttons, Text Fields, and Labels, this section was quick. Aligning everything
with Grid Pane is simple as well. The only hiccup I had here was that I had not
encountered having to align an object within its grid space. I was able to achieve
this by taking a look at the JavaFX documentation. You can see what I did in line
94.
```

Step two:

Step three:

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
